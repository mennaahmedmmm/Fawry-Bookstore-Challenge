## üß† Object-Oriented Concepts Used

- **Abstraction:** Abstract class `Book` defines shared attributes and behaviors.
- **Inheritance:** `PaperBook`, `EBook`, and `ShowcaseBook` extend `Book`.
- **Polymorphism:** `deliver()` method behaves differently for each book type.
- **Encapsulation:** Book attributes are private/final with public getters.
- **Interfaces:** `ShippingService` and `MailService` are used for delivery logic injection.
